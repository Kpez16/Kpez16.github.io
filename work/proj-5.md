This showcase has been an on going project for my current full-time position. I am the assistant manager of a student housing complex in Norman, OK. I handle the local marketing, social media marketing, and print/promotional item design.

These are a few of my favorite pieces including flyers, shirts/tanks, and brochures/business cards.
