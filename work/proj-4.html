<h2>Pixel Art RPG Concept</h2>

<p>
  This is a passion project that I decided to turn into a potential real game
  concept. Utilizing knowledge gained from ELVTR's UX/UI for gaming course
  content, I was able to create a Game Design Document, a base layer of assets,
  and a general script for demo ready gameplay.
