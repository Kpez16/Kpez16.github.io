    PCI Energy Solutions is a comprehensive software suite for energy
    optimization, wholesale market trading, and management.
  </h3>

  <p>
    Recently PCI invested heavily in adopting a user-centric approach to their
    product design. Up until this point, product teams made their own decisions
    about their chosen front-end technologies and design choices. The design
    choices were made purely from a functional standpoint and over time the
    entire product suite became a frankensteined implementation requiring
    extensive training to understand, let alone use.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    This lead our newly implemented UX team to take on the task of creating a
    Design System that would fit the copmpanies needs. The goals were simple:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gain consistency across different products</li>
    <li>
      Provide developers, future designers, and product stakeholders a robust
      guide to build new applications or enhance exzisting ones
    </li>
    <li>Allow for faster development with less need for solution finding</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>
    Given the existing nature and company culture, it was easy to determine that
    a unified component library was necessary for teams to ensure they can build
    consistent experiences across a large array of products.

  <h3>Foundations</h3>
  <p>
    After working with our UI Developers and researching multiple foundational
    libraries, we determined using
    <a href="https://primereact.org/">Prime React UI</a> as a basis would be
    ideal for our needs. We would be utilizing React JS to build the Kube UI
    Apps. The PCI Kube Design System would encompass design patterns, styles,
    and custom versions of components in a single location.
  </p>
  <h3>Documentation is Key</h3>
  <p>
    As with any good Design System, we maintain and edit our documentation and
    system as new patterns emerge and prove efficient. It is a living system
    within the product development process that will change and evolve overtime.

  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    During the initial phases, the design team consisted of 2 members. The
    original styles and components were created in Adobe XD by myself and our UX
    manager.
  </p>
  <p>
    We transitioned to Figma towards the end of the 2022 year. I took on the
    role of transferring existing components into Figma. During this time, I was
    able to create a much more organized and useable file structure and became
    our Figma Guru of sorts. Finding solutions to meet our specific design needs
    is a passion of mine now.

  <h3>Data Grids Ex:</h3>

  <h3>Where we are now / Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    Since then I have been maintaining, enahncing, and documenting our Design
    System on a near daily basis. We are constantly reviewing accessibility
    standards, Figma specific features, and other design systems so that we can
    provide PCI the ability to develop products seemlessly!
