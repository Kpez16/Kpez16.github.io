title: Ecomm App with Ruby on Rails
---

This will showcase an ecommapp I built as a project from the ground up. Utilizing Angular, Ajax, Bootstrap, and multiple APIs. This is more of a full-stack project rather than a design project. 

I will be revisiting this project soon to re-style in a more modern ecomm site style.
